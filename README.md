# Blog
Don't have much to say just a simple blog made with bottle, has a problem when i uploaded to pythonanywhere (,only login page could be viewed),decided to drop it here so that when i have time to find and fix the issue won't have to start from scratch

*********
This wasn't the original code I planned to update. This is a different one that I've successfully uploaded to Pythonanywhere and it's running awesomely.
I don't have the revised code, for Pythonanywhere anywhere on my local system.
What I have is code that can be run locally on your ip address\localhost.

I'll update the Pythonanywhere account, before the end of the year as a v1.1.

Thank you,
Adrielloks
